6♣5♣ / 5♠6♣
yes as all the other cards go in twos there is no way a card can be left that is not part of the three set
No as it all just depnds on how the cards shuffled to depend on what cards come out next, and if there is more than one option no matter what you draw you still have at least one more turn
